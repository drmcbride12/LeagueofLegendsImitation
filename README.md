grab that file and follow these steps:
Step 1: make a new folder name it whatever you please.
Step 2: open said folder place the exe in there.
Step 3: make sure your main monitor has nothing personal open (I dont want your data!)
Step 4: run the exe and queue up for league games and close the file when you want it to stop collecting.

Step 5: if you have any suspicion of it not collecting the right data please remove it before sending it to me and send me the results.
Step 6: Profit bud. (send it to me using google drive,discord,mega whatever you decide on through dms or in the donation channel)
fyi the donation channel is only visable by me so you don't have to worry about bad actors.
